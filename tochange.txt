## Key Generation ##

1. [X] Move the Encryption Algorithm from LockBox_Main to \pyth\keygen.py

2. [ ] Change encryption key generation
    - Use 3 random images out of x number of images
    - Take 3 pixels from each image
    - Average out RGB of image pixels
    - Then average out those averages
    - Mutiply first two, add the second

3. [ ] Change FinalList()
    - Make it so that included images are used to convert the FinalList of numbers into a mixture of letters, numbers, and special characters. 
    - Numbers --> Letters & Characters based on certain random positions inside of specefied images

4. [ ] Create Key Storage & Get Methods
    - Create a set num of images, all with randomized RGB values for every pixel
    - Each image is (500x500) pixels, * 5 images = 1,250,000 pixels in total
    - One pixel in the image has RGB pixels that will translate to the encryption key
    - Said pixel can be manually entered, or saved somewhere else

5. [ ] Make Encryption & Decryption Algorithm 
    - Must be able to Ecnrypt/Decrypt strings, numbers, and characters / symbols. 
    - Encryption / decryption should take less that 30 seconds / 500 characters.

6. [ ] Rework the EncDec Keygen
